# Flight-Management-System
A Flight Management System built in C with GTK+ 3 that lets different user roles (Admin, Flight Scheduler, Crew Scheduler, Viewer) manage flights, runways, and crew. It supports adding/modifying/deleting flights, runway assignment, crew scheduling with various constraints, real-time event simulations, search, and auto-generated reports.
